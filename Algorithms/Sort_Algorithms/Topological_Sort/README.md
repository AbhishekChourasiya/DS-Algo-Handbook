Definition:
A topological sort of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and algorithms are known for constructing a topological ordering of any DAG in linear time.

Algorithm:
L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
while there are unmarked nodes do
    select an unmarked node n
    visit(n) 

function visit(node n)
    if n has a temporary mark then stop (not a DAG)
    if n is not marked (i.e. has not been visited yet) then
        mark n temporarily
        for each node m with an edge from n to m do
            visit(m)
        mark n permanently
        unmark n temporarily
        add n to head of L

Complexity:
Algorithm for topological sort is simply DFS with an extra stack. So time complexity is same as DFS which is O(V+E).
