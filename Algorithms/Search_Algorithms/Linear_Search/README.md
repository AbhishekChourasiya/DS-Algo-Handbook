#Linear Search

Linear Search is the most simple way to find a target value in an array or list.

##Algorithm

In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. 
Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned.
Otherwise the search continues till the end of the array or list.

##Complexity

Linear Search takes O(N) time to run since at max it will iterate over all the items of the list or array.
